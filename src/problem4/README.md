## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
    - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **npm** or **yarn**:

    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vite-project.git
    cd vite-project
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

## Running the Development Server

Start the Vite development server to preview the application:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

After running the command, the terminal will display the development server's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Open the URL in your browser to see the app.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the project:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The built files will be available in the `dist/` directory. You can serve them using any static file server.

## Preview Production Build

To locally preview the production build:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn preview
```

This will serve the files in the `dist/` directory on a local server.
